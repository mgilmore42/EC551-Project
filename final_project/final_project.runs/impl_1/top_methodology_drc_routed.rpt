There is a large setup violation of -5.037 ns between mc/FSM_sequential_rs_c_reg[0]_rep__1/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and alu/dout_reg[9]/S (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
